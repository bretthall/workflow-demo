# Workflow Demo

This is demo code for the talk [Using Free Monads to Simplify Workflows](https://www.openfsharp.org/speakers/2019/brett-hall/) at [Open F# 2019](https://www.openfsharp.org). 

## Building

Currently [.Net Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) 2.2 or newer is required. I'm trying to lower that requirement to 2.1, but having problems (it will build with 2.1 but then runtime errors about missing assemblies will occur). I'll update here if I get things working.

To build simply do `dotnet build`. The first time this is done you will need an internet connection so that Nuget packages can be installed.

## Running

There are three programs that can be run:

* device: A _device_ that the workflow will control.
* control: Runs workflows that control a device.
* test: Unit tests for workflows.

Each of them can be run by using `dotnet run -p <project>/<project>.fsproj` from the root of the source tree (`<project>` is one of `device`, `control`, or `test`).

Note that `control` won't do anything until `device` is started. Once you start a program the terminal that it is started from will be tied up until that program exits.
